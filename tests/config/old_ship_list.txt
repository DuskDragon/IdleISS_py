Combat Statistics and Values Developing Strategy:
----------------------------------
let's approximate that a round is 30 seconds
then let's say max battle length is 10 minutes
thus: max rounds is 20

1 v 1 frigates get a kill in a single round
destroyers kill 2-3 frigates per round - 1 frigate might kill a destroyer
3 rounds for a frigate to kill a cruiser, but the cruiser would kill 3 frigates in that time
5 frigates kill a battlecruiser in about 3 rounds, but those frigates would likely all die
10 frigates kill a battleship in about 3 rounds, and the battleship might kill one (drones?)

destroyer can kill 1-3 destroyers per round
destroyer kills a cruiser in 2 rounds, but cruisers kill 2-3 destroyers per round
destroyer takes 6 rounds to kill a BC, but BC can kill about 1 destroyer each round
destroyer kills a battleship in 13 rounds, but that battleship will kill the destroyer first with drones

cruiser 1v1 get a kill in a single round
cruiser kills a battlecruiser in 3-4 rounds, but battlecruisers kill 1-2 cruisers per round
cruiser kills a battleship in 10 rounds but a battleship would likely kill 3-5 cruisers in that time

Battlecruiser 1v1 takes 3-4 rounds
Battlecruiser kills battleship in 10 rounds, but in that time 10 bcs would die

Battleship 1v1s take 3-4 rounds
