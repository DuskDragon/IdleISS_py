TODO:
    BUILDING PRODUCTION
        setup checks to try to build next building in progression
        add building production logic to user
            setup 'modes'
                security
                    player can pick which security to focus on
                economic
                    produce structures
                defensive
                    produce fleets
                offensive
                    conquer systems
                mixed
                    build everything (slowly)
    DEBRIS FIELD
        add debris field generation to battle
        add solar system support for debris field
        implement cargosize on ships
        develop fleet management system
        implement dispaches to debris field

DOCS:
 - Progression:
    Basic Income

    Early
    Construct small commerical stations (CS) for basic resources
    Construct small engineering stations (ES) for larger sized ships
    Construct small drilling platforms (DP) for advanced resources

    Mid
    Conquer Systems using System Control Hubs (SCH)
    Construct medium ES for capital ships
    Construct medium DP for more advanced resources
    Construct medium CS for more basic resources

    Late
    Construct large ES for supercapital ships
    Construct system fortress (SF) to hold control of SCH, adds an additional defense layer to SCH

 - AI Controlled Player Interaction
    Uses point system
        Prevent new players from being attacked by players with more than 3x their points
    Once a player achieves a new teir they cannot expand into the lower teir systems
    Players can destroy each other's structures
        medium drilling platforms can be destroyed, but new mediums need SCH
    SCH cannot be destroyed until the system fortress is destroyed

 - Universe
    High Security
        small CS and ES can be constructed
            make much less money, protected against other players
    Low Security
        medium CS and ES can be constructed
            make more money, but only have 3x point protection
        Small DP can be constructed
    Null Security
        All buildings can be constructed
            make most money
        No player protections

 - Pilot simulation?
    skill level, "effort", timezone, "morale", spies?, inventory?

 - Security designation:
        Manual?

        Need to use NetworkX or graph-tool to find a "measure of center", then using a counting floodfill assign high, low, and null
        Then update region names based on overall security of region
        Then update constellation names based on region names (high, low, null)
        Then update system names based on constellation names (high, low)
        Keep null system names randomly generated

 - Winning a universe round?
    should IdleISS be perpetual? or run Monthly rounds?
    Victory conditions?
        Most Systems
        Most Ships Killed
        Most Resources/Points Killed
        Most Resources/Points Efficient
        Most Resources Acquired

    Universe seed: (placeholder)

ARCHIVE:
 - Solar System Layout
    Universe config sanity check
        Check there are NO name collisions at all (constellations, regions, systems, etc)
    non-directed graph
    1-7 connections per system
    find 1907 "names" for high and lowsec
        generate 5100 systems:
            end goal target numbers:
                1090 highsec
                 817 lowsec
                3193 nullsec
        start with 5100 nodes
        collect nodes into 340 constellations (15 nodes each)
        collect constellations into 68 regions (5 constellations each)
        sparsely connect nodes within constellations (1-3 per system, floodfill verified)
        sparsely connect constellations within regions (1-2 per constellation, floodfill verified)
        sparsely connect regions within the universe (4 per region, floodfill verified)
        use graph-tool to draw universe map
